This is repo for the cube

The Layout of the program goes as such:

  void loop calls mainSwitch
  
 mainSwitch is the overview function that switches between different mini programs aka 'void functions()'
 
 mini programs are just self contained loops that only exit when ESC is pressed
 
 all mini programs must be stored in the appFunctions[] (will soon be [][]) pointer array
 
 will most likely make a mini programs file just for their code, and a supporting functions one too
